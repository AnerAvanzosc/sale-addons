==================================================
Sale Order Line Input Access Button on Sale Orders
==================================================

This module extends **Sale Orders** and **Sale Order Lines** to improve usability by providing a direct shortcut to access and manage order lines from the sale order form.

Key Features
============
- Adds an **"Open Order Lines"** button on the sale order form.
- Opens a dedicated list view of **Sale Order Lines**, filtered by the current order.
- Context is automatically passed, so new lines created from this view are linked to the selected order.
- Displays the **Commitment Date** field in order lines, showing the promised delivery date.
- Improves usability for sales teams to review and edit multiple lines quickly.

Configuration
=============
1. Install the module.
2. Go to **Sales → Orders → Quotations / Sale Orders**.
3. Open any order and locate the **"Open Order Lines"** button in the header.
4. Click the button to view and manage all lines of that order directly.
5. Commitment dates are visible in the lines list view.
